# Programming Language Salaries and Demand

I conducted a fun experiment using Stack Overflow data from 2022 to 2024, analyzing technologies based on their popularity, average salary, and associated specialized roles. This is purely statisticalâ€”I'm not drawing conclusions or suggesting any particular choice over another, just sharing the insights.
